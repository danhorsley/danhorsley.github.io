Here are a few details about me:

- Sometime long ago, almost before computers were invented, I trained as a pure mathematician at Oxford University
- I left academia to pursue a career in finance and spent the next twenty years working as a derivative and convertible bond trader...
- ...before eventually setting up my own hedge fund.
- Data Science has become the dominant force not only in my industry of expertise, but almost every industry globally so..
- I am taking some time to update my skillset and trying to combine the things I've learned previously with this ever growing field

## What else?

 - I live in the UK where it rains a lot and people generally [act like this.](https://twitter.com/SoVeryBritish)
 - I have two pet children and one pet dog
 - I play piano and guitar and also run slowly
